Since all nodes have low battery storage, we cannot rely on batteries to mitigate the deficit. However, since the deficit is within normal operating parameters, immediate action isn\u2019t critical. \n\nTo manage the situation:\n- Implement demand response programs to reduce peak demand.\n- Increase generation capacity temporarily if feasible.\n- Address the high-risk nodes sequentially to prevent potential failures.\n\n### Strategic Questions for Planner:\n1.
