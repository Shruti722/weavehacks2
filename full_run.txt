Analyst: ### Analysis Insights:
1. **Spatial Clustering:** The problems are scattered across the city, indicating a capacity shortage rather than transmission issues.
2. **Storage Strategy:** All nodes are bel...

Planner: To create the final action plan, let's first evaluate the tradeoffs between different strategies and then prioritize the nodes based on their impact.
